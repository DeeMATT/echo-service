QUESTION:

Without implementing them, suggest possible future improvements of your solution,
especially for production cases with high loads.


ANSWER:
For production use-cases with heavy or very spiky load, a possible improvement would be to offload the rate limiting functionality to an external service so as to prevent resources from being wasted within the application. 

Ideally, this follows the single responsibility principle, and at the coarse-grained architecture level, we may require that the rate limiting functionality is provided by an external component that has this responsibility.

We can also use an intermediary to buffer the initiation or send requests, perhaps placing the request within a queue.

For example, using some form of proxy or gateway that trips a circuit-breaker when the downstream service is not accepting any more requests.
